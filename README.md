MinG
====

A small module for working with Stabler's Minimalist Grammars in Perl6.

STRUCTURE
=========

As of now there are two (sub)modules: MinG and MinG::S13.

In MinG, you'll find the necessary classes and subroutines for creating descriptions of Minimalist Grammars. It's not of much use by itself unless you're planning to implement your own parser/etc. and want to save yourself the time of having to define classes and useful functions.

In MinG::S13, you'll find Stabler's (2013) "Two models of minimalist, incremental syntactic analysis" parser. Currently, this parser analyses all possibilities, while Stabler's parser discards low-probability derivations.

More documentation can be found in HTML files inside the doc/ directory.

INSTALLATION
============

If you have perl6 and panda or zef, the following should suffice:

        git clone https://github.com/IanTayler/MinG.git
        cd MinG
        panda install .

If you don't, the easiest is probably to install rakudobrew <https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew> and then run:

        rakudobrew build moar
        rakudobrew build panda

and you should be ready to clone and install this repository.

The module is currently ready for distribution, so I might add it to the Perl6 environment so that you can install it with "panda install MinG".

CURRENTLY
=========

  * Has classes that correctly describe MGs (MinG::Grammar), MG-LIs (MinG::LItem) and MG-style-features (MinG::Feature).

  * Has a subroutine (feature_from_str) that takes a string description of a feature (e.g. "=D") and returns a MinG::Feature.

  * Has lexical trees for Stabler's (2013) parsing method (MinG::Grammar.litem_tree).

  * Automatically generates LaTeX/qtree code for trees. (Node.qtree inside MinG)

  * Has a merge-only working parser for MGs! (MinG::S13::Parser or MinG::S13.parse_and_spit())

  * Has a parser that reads grammars from a file! (MinG::From::Text)

TODO
====

  * Fix issues #1, #2 (Will bump to 0.6.0 directly)

  * Finish the parser so that it includes move-cases. (Will bump to 1.0.0)

  * Allow some useful expansions of MGs.

  * Make the parser more efficient by adding probabilistic rule-following.

MAYDO
=====

  * Create a probabilistic trainer.

  * Use annotated corpora to build lexical entries.

  * Use a small subset of predefined lexical entries and a non-annotated corpus to "guess" the feature specification of unknown lexical items.

  * Create a Montague-style semantics for MG trees.

  * Create a world-model for a knowledgable AI using such semantics.
